## the API

## the Stack

* **The Front End**
  * Handcrafted HTML with artisanal CSS including a custom grid.
  * Modeled in React-flavored-jQuery with componentized rendering elements and unidirectional data flow.
  * Not currently as responsive as it should be...sorry ðŸ˜¢
* **The Back End**
  * Standard M E _ N stack setup.
  * Mongo instance hosted on mLab with Mongoose for object modeling.
    * Also used Faker extensively for creating test data.
  * An Odyssian Express router journey littered with the corpses of abandoned endpoints.
  * Mocha and Chai for testing.
  * Authentication soon to be deployed with Passport.
  * All built in Node and hosted in Heroku with Travis for CI.
* **Dev Process**
  * Pretty simple tooling:
    * Atom & Postman for most everything.
